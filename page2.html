            <h2>IVF</h2>
            <p>IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is a medical procedure where a woman's egg is
                fertilized by a man's sperm outside the body in a lab, allowing for embryo
                implantation in the uterus to potentially achieve pregnancy.
                
                In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the joining of a woman's egg and a man's
                sperm in a laboratory dish. In vitro means outside the body.
                Ferti lization means thesperm has attached to and entered the egg.</p>

            <h2> What is In Vitro Fertilization</h2>
            <p>"In vitro fertilization" (IVF) in short means a process where an egg
                is fertilized by sperm outside the body, in a laboratory, and then the
                fertilized egg (embryo) is transferred to a woman's uterus to potentially develop into a pregnancy;
                essentially, a method to assist with
                conception for couples experiencing fertility issues.</p>

            <h2>How IVF works</h2>
            <p>IVF (In vitro fertilization) is a fertility treatment where eggs are retrieved from a woman’s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a lab. After fertilization, the best-quality embryos are selected and transferred into the woman’s uterus in the hope that one will implant and develop into a pregnancy. The process involves ovarian stimulation with hormones to produce multiple eggs, egg retrieval, sperm collection, and embryo culture. A pregnancy test is done a few weeks later to check if implantation was successful. IVF helps individuals or couples facing fertility challenges conceive.</p>

            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>PREPARATION</summary>
                <P>The first step involves stimulating the ovaries to produce multiple eggs instead of just one. This is done with hormone injections that help the ovaries produce several mature eggs. The progress is closely monitored with blood tests and ultrasounds to check the number and size of the eggs.</P>
            </details>

            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>EGG RETRIEVAL</summary>
                <p>Once the eggs are ready, they are retrieved from the ovaries.
                    This is done through a minor surgical procedure under sedation, where a thin needle is inserted
                    through the vaginal wall to collect the eggs</p>
            </details>

            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>SPERM PRED</summary>
                <p>On the same day, sperm is collected from the male partner or a sperm donor. The sperm is then
                    processed to find the healthiest, most motile sperm.

                </p>

            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>EGG INSEMINATION</summary>
                <p>The eggs and sperm are combined in the laboratory. In some cases, if there are fertility issues with
                    sperm quality, ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) may be used,
                    where a single sperm is directly injected into an egg. The eggs are monitored to ensure
                    fertilization occurs.</p>

            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT</summary>
                <p>The fertilized eggs (embryos) are kept in the lab for several days to grow. The embryologist monitors
                    their development to select the healthiest ones.</p>
            </details>



            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>PREPARING FOR TRANSFER</summary>
                <p>After 3-5 days, one or more healthy embryos are chosen
                    and transferred into the woman’s uterus. This is a relatively simple procedure and doesn’t usually
                    require anesthesia.</p>
            </details>




            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>PREGNANCY TEST</summary>
                <p> About 10-14 days after the embryo transfer, a blood test is done to check if implantation has
                    occurred and if the woman is pregnant.</p>
            </details>



            <details style="margin: 30px;">
                <summary>FOLLOW UP</summary>
                <p>Regular follow-up care is critical to ensure both the health of the woman and the baby.
                    The process can be emotionally and physically taxing, so emotional support is also important during
                    this time.</p>

            <h2>Is IVF right for me?</h2>
            <p>Deciding whether IVF (in vitro fertilization) is right for you depends on several factors related to your
                fertility, health, and personal circumstances. IVF is often used when other fertility treatments haven’t
                been successful or when there are specific issues that make conception difficult. Here are some key
                points to consider when determining if IVF might be a good option for you:</p>
